AND join_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01'
AND '2024-12-31';

-- Q10. Find all orders placed between '2024-08-10' and '2024-08-25' (inclusive) that are NOT cancelled.

-- Q11. Explain what the index idx_orders_date does. How would it improve the performance of a query that filters orders by order_date? Write a sample query that would benefit from this index. 

SELECT *

WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-08-01'
AND '2024-08-31';

-- Q12. If you run: SELECT * FROM customers WHERE YEAR(join_date) = 2024; — would the index on join_date be used? Explain why or why not, and rewrite the query to be index-friendly (SARGable).

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE join_date
BETWEEN '2024-01-01'
AND '2024-12-31';
